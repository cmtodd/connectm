"""
Classes (actually just one) for implementing Connect-M
(a general version of Connect-4).h

Examples:

    1) Creating a board::

        board = ConnectMBoard(6, 7, 4)

    2) Dropping a piece::

        if board.can_drop(col):
            board.drop(col, PieceColor.RED)

    3) Checking for a winner::

        winner = board.get_winner()
        if winner == PieceColor.RED:
            print("Red wins!")
        elif winner == PieceColor.YELLOW:
            print("Yellow wins!")
        else:
            print("No winner")
